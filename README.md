# Number Guessing Game

It's just another *Number Guessing Game*. Just practicing. 

(The project idea is from https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game).

For now it's CLI game, in which you can:

- [x] select difficulty (number of chances);
- [x] enter your guess;
- [x] playing non stop;
- [x] contemplate ingeniously designed text messages;
- [x] decide whether to use extended hints ot not (whether the number is devisible by random number);
- [x] see time it took you to guess;
- [x] gather statistics (spared tries and time at this difficulty level);
- [x] enjoy *(if you're not picky at games only).

But I'm afraid, you should have python interpreter on you PC to play this game (yeah, it's just a python script).
